 You can work with entities like working with classes
 A class is automatically generated by Swift for each entitiy name with the defined attributes as properties
 
 You can store images as binary data, but it isn't efficient to store in Core Data if images are too large (better to store URL string and access image file using URL)
 
 A persistent container is a container that encapsulates the Core Data stack in the application
 It simplifies the creation and management of the Core Data stack by handling the creation of the NSManagedObjectModel, the NSManagedObjectContext, and the NSPersistentStoreContainer
 
 The Managed Object Context sits at the top of the Core Data stack and provides an interface between the requests sent to the database, the actual database, and the answer sent back from the database as an array called the 'Managed Object' (see 'Core Data Fetch Flow' in Core Data folder)
 
 Do better error handling in 'Core Data' methods in 'AppDelegate.swift' if doing production apps
 
 'AppDelegate.swift' is a file that has a set of methods that control the basic functions of an app
